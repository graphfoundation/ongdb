== What is ONgDB?  ==

https://graphfoundation.org[ONgDB] _/ Owen-Gee-Dee-Bee /_ which stands for Open Native Graph Database, is an open source, high performance, native graph store with everything you would expect from an enterprise-ready database, including high availability clustering, ACID transactions, and an intuitive, pattern-centric graph query language.
Developers use graph theory-based structures that we call nodes and relationships instead of rows and columns.
For many use cases, ONgDB will provide orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to non-native graph, relational and NoSQL databases.

== Using ONgDB ==

ONgDB is available both as a standalone server or an embeddable component.

== Extending ONgDB ==

We encourage experimentation with ONgDB.
You can build plugins to ONgDB, develop library or drivers atop the product, or make contributions directly to the product core.
You'll need to sign the Graph Foundation Contributor License Agreement to become a contributor.

Our Community edition (in the link:community/[community/] directory) is GPLv3. Our Enterprise edition (link:enterprise/[enterprise/]) is differently licensed under the AGPLv3.

== Dependencies ==

ONgDB is built using http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] version 3.6. Maven requires more memory than the standard configuration which can be achieved with `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m"`.

== Building ONgDB ==

Before you start running the unit and integration tests in the ONgDB Maven project on a Linux-like system, you should ensure the limit on open files is set to a reasonable value.
You can test it with `ulimit -n`.
We recommend you have a limit of at least 40K.

* Run `mvn clean install -DfullBuild -Drevapi.skip=true -DcreateChecksum=true` to build end-to-end with all tests.
* In case you want to skip tests add the `-DskipTests` flag to the previous command.
* You may need to increase the memory available to Maven: `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m"`.

== Running ONgDB ==

After building, cd into `packaging/standalone/target` and extract the edition you want, then

  bin/ongdb start

in the extracted folder to start ONgDB on `localhost:7474`.

On Windows you want to run

  bin\ongdb start

instead.
