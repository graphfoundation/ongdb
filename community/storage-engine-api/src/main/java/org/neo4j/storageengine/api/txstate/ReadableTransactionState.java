     * token mini-transaction, separate from the surrounding transaction that creates or modifies data that need it.
     * From the kernel POV it's interesting to know whether or not any tokens have been created in this tx state, because then we know it's a mini-transaction
     * like this and won't have to let transaction event handlers know about it, for example.
     * <p>
     * The same applies to schema changes, such as creating and dropping indexes and constraints.
     * <p>
     * The fulltext schema indexes also use the data revision to determine at query-time, if their internal transaction state needs to be updated.
