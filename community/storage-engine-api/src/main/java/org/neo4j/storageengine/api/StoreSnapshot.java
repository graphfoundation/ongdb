/**
 * Represents a "snapshot" of a Neo4j store.
 *
 * The snapshot doesn't contain the bytes of an actual store, of course. It would perhaps be more accurate to say
 * that instances of this class are blueprints from which a true store snapshot can be constructed.
 *
 * In general this works by providing a list of Neo4j store files, along with the latest transaction to be closed/applied
 * against them at the time the snapshot is created. Recipients of a StoreSnapshot object may then construct a copy
 * of the store by retrieving each of the files in the list (see {@code recoverableFiles}), then applying any transactions
 * occurring after the snapshot's latest (i.e. via Recovery).
 *
 * Recovery is required because transactions may have been applied between creating the StoreSnapshot and retrieving the last
 * store file, changing some store files to be logically inconsistent with others.
 *
 * Note: several of the files in a Neo4j store are not updated transactionally, may not be recovered, and must be retrieved in
 * *exactly* the same state as they are in when the StoreSnapshot is created (see {@code unrecoverableFiles}).
 *
 * In an attempt to ensure this, the {@link StoreSnapshot.Factory} implementations claim a lock on the database
 * checkpointer when creating a StoreSnapshot. This lock is released when calling {@link #close()}. The stream
 * of unrecoverable files should be exhausted, and the snapshot closed, as fast as possible.
