    // First it looks for plugins Log4j2Plugins.dat (plugins listing files) files in META-INF on the class path.
    // It will find both our and any external one, and it is the first one found to decides how the mapping will be.

    // plugins will be mapped to either the shaded version or the non-shaded version (decided by what is first on class path) and only work for
    // either us or the external version.
    // We work around this by not having any Log4jPlugins.dat file so that we don't create problems for embedded users' Log4j.
    // We fool the internal Log4j that we have already searched for Log4j2Plugins.dat files so that it won't find any external ones, and then search in
    // the packages we specify instead.
