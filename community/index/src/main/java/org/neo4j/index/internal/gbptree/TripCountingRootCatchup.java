/**
 * This class counts the number of round trips we take from the same node back to
 * root in a row and throw {@link TreeInconsistencyException} if it becomes too many.
 * <p>
 * Starting over from root happens when a seek cursor ended up on an unexpected node, such as
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Node is internal when we actually expect it to be a leaf.</li>
 *  <li>Generation of node is higher than the generation of the pointer that we followed to get here.</li>
 *  <li>Generation of the node differs from the generation we expected it to have based on previous lookup.</li>
 *  <li>Node is not a tree node.</li>
 * </ul>
 * All of those cases are either a result of a concurrent update changing the
 * structure of the tree, e.g. if the page we wanted to visit was reused for
 * something else before we got there, or the tree is in an inconsistent
 * state.
 * If the tree is inconsistent it is likely that we end up here again after
 * retrying from root and thus we will loop here forever. To avoid this we
 * keep track of the last page that we jumped to root from and if we loop
 * from the same place enough times we will throw an exception.
