/**
 * The JobHandle implementation for jobs scheduled with the {@link TimeBasedTaskScheduler}.
 * <p>
 * As the handle gets scheduled, it transitions through various states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The handle is initially in the RUNNABLE state, which means that it is ready to be executed but isn't
 * scheduled to do so yet.</li>
 * <li>When it gets scheduled, it transitions into the SUBMITTED state after which it transitions to EXECUTING state,
 * when it starts being executed by a thread</li>
 * <li>A handle that is in the SUBMITTED or EXECUTING state cannot be submitted again, even if it comes due.</li>
 * <li>A handle that is both due and in SUBMITTED or EXECUTING state is <em>overdue</em>, and its execution will be delayed until it
 * changes out of the SUBMITTED state.</li>
 * <li>If a scheduled handle successfully finishes its execution, it will transition back to the RUNNABLE state.</li>
 * <li>If an exception is thrown during the execution, then the handle transitions to the FAILED state in case task is not recurring,
 * otherwise its rescheduled for next execution.</li>
 * </ul>
