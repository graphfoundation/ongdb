/**
 * <h1>Forseti, the Nordic god of justice</h1>
 * <p/>
 * Forseti is a lock manager using the dreadlocks deadlock detection algorithm, which means
 * deadlock detection does not require complex RAG traversal and can be found in O(1).
 * <p/>
 * In the best case, Forseti acquires a lock in one CAS instruction, and scales linearly with the number of cores.
 * However, since it uses a shared-memory approach, it will most likely degrade in use cases where there is high
 * contention and a very large number of sockets running the database.
 * <p/>
 * As such, it is optimized for servers with up to, say, 16 cores across 2 sockets. Past that other strategies such
 * as centralized lock services using message passing may yield better results.
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Locking algorithm</h2>
 * <p/>
 * Forseti is used by acquiring clients, which act as agents on behalf of whoever wants to grab locks. The clients
 * have access to a central map of locks.
 * <p/>
 * To grab a lock, a client must insert itself into the holder list of the lock it wants. The lock may either be a
 * shared lock or an exclusive lock. In the case of a shared lock, the client simply appends itself to the holder list.
 * In the case of an exclusive lock, the client has it's own unique exclusive lock, which it must put into the lock map
 * using a CAS operation.
 * <p/>
 * Once the client is in the holder list, it has the lock.
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Deadlock detection</h2>
 * <p/>
 * Each Client maintains a waiting-for list, which by default always contains the client itself. This list indicates
 * which other clients are blocking our progress. By default, then, if client A is waiting for no-one, its waiting-for
 * list will contain only itself:
 * <p/>
 * A.waitlist = [A]
 * <p/>
 * Once the client is blocked by someone else, it will copy this someones entire wait list into it's own. Assuming A
 * becomes blocked by B, and B has a wait list of:
 * <p/>
 * B.waitlist = [B]
 * <p/>
 * Then A will modify is's wait list as:
 * <p/>
 * A.waitlist = [A] U [B] => [A,B]
 * <p/>
 * It will do this in a loop, continuously figuring out the union of wait lists for all clients it waits for. The magic
 * then happens whenever one of those clients become blocked on client A. Assuming client B now has to wait for A,
 * it will also perform a union of A's wait list (which is [A,B] at this point):
 * <p/>
 * B.waitlist = [B] U [A,B]
 * <p/>
 * As it performs this union, B will find itself in A's waiting list, and when it does, it has detected a deadlock.
 * <p/>
 * This algorithm always identifies real deadlocks, but it may also mistakenly identify a deadlock where there is none;
 * a false positive. For this reason, we have a secondary deadlock verification algorithm that only runs if the
 * algorithm above found what appears to be a deadlock.
 * <p/>
 * The secondary deadlock verification algorithm works like this: Whenever a lock client blocks to wait on a lock, the
 * lock is stored in the clients `waitsFor` field, and the field is cleared when the client unblocks. Since every lock
 * track their owners, we now have all the information we need to traverse the waiter/lock-holder dependency graph to
 * verify that a cycle really does exist.
 * <p/>
 * We first collect the owners of the lock that we are blocking upon. From there, we need to find a lock that one of
 * these lock-owners are waiting on, and have us amongst its owners. So to recap, we collect the immediate owners of
 * the lock that we are immediately blocked upon, then we collect the set of locks that they are waiting upon, and then
 * we collect the combined set of owners of <em>those</em> locks, and if we are amongst those, then we consider the
 * deadlock is real. If we are not amongst those owners, then we take another step out into the graph, collect the next
 * frontier of locks that are waited upon, and their owners, and then we check again in this new owner set. We continue
 * traversing the graph like this until we either find ourselves amongst the owners - a deadlock - or we run out of
 * locks that are being waited upon - no deadlock.
 * <p/>
