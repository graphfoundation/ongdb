     * Composite queries are somewhat restricted in what combination of predicates
     * that are allowed together and in what order.
     *
     * 1. Decreasing precision.
     * Composite queries must have decreasing precision on the slots, meaning
     * for example that a range predicate can not be followed by an exact
     * predicate.
     * The reason for this is that because the index is sorted in lexicographic
     * order in regard to the slots a predicate with increasing precision
     * does not narrow down the search space in the index.
     * It could of course be implemented by scanning the search space and do
     * post filtering, but this is not how the implementation currently works.
     *
     * 2. Contains and suffix.
     * Contains or suffix queries are not allowed in composite queries at all.
     * This is because they both demand a full scan of the search space, just like
     * "exist", and the post filtering of the result. This is how it works in the
     * non-composite case, but it has not yet been implemented for the composite case.
     *
     * 3. AllEntries
     * The allEntries query also is not allowed in composite queries, due to its semantic
     * meaning to return everything in the index; thus does a full scan of the search
     * space. This is similar to "exist", but is tied to the index, rather than a
     * particular property key.
     *
     * @param predicates The query for which we want to check the composite validity.
