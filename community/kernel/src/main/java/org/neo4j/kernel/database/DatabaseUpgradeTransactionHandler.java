    // - Transaction A generates commands (with DBMS runtime version 1)
    // - DBMS runtime version is set to 2

     * The general idea here is to register a transaction listener only if we are in a pending upgrade scenario.
     * The listener will before any other committed transaction create an "internal" transaction bringing the database up to date with the system database.
     * This transaction will act as a recoverable and safe "barrier" after which it is safe to use the new transaction log version.
     * The new version will then be used for the same transaction that triggered this upgrade in the first place.
     * On success it will unregister itself to get rid of any potential overhead during normal operation.
     *
     * In the rare event of the "internal" upgrade transaction failing, it will stay on the old version and fail all transactions for this db
     * until it succeeds.
