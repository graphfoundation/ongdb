/**
 * Similar to {@link PhysicalTransactionCursor} and actually uses it internally. This main difference is that transactions
 * are returned in reverse order, starting from the end and back towards (and including) a specified {@link LogPosition}.
 *
 * Since the transaction log format lacks data which would allow for a memory efficient reverse reading implementation,
 * this implementation tries to minimize peak memory consumption by efficiently reading a single log version at a time
 * in reverse order before moving over to the previous version. Peak memory consumption compared to normal
 * {@link PhysicalTransactionCursor} should be negligible due to the offset mapping that {@link ReversedSingleFileTransactionCursor}
 * does.
