 * Looks up "input id" from a node. This is used when importing nodes and where the input data specifies ids
 * using its own id name space, such as arbitrary strings. Those ids are called input ids and are converted
 * into actual record ids during import. However there may be duplicate such input ids in the input data
 * and the {@link EncodingIdMapper} may need to double check some input ids since it's only caching a hash
 * of the input id in memory. The input ids are stored as properties on the nodes to be able to retrieve
