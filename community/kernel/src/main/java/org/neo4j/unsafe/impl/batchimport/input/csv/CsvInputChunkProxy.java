/**
 * {@link CsvInputChunk} that adapts new input source groups during the streaming of data.
 * {@link InputIterator} is fairly straight-forward, but is made a bit more complicated by the fact that
 * there can be multiple different data streams. The outer iterator, {@link CsvGroupInputIterator}, is still responsible
 * for handing out chunks, something that generally is good thing since it solves a bunch of other problems.
 * The problem it has is that it doesn't know exactly which type of {@link CsvInputChunk} it wants to create,
 * because that's up to each input group. This gap is bridged here in this class.
