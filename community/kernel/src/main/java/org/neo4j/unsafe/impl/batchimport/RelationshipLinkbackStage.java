 * Sets {@link RelationshipRecord#setFirstPrevRel(long)} and {@link RelationshipRecord#setSecondPrevRel(long)}

 * to link chains together. Steps:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link ReadRecordsStep} reads records from store and passes on downwards to be processed.
 * Ids are read page-wise by {@link RecordIdIterator}, where each page is read forwards internally,
 * i.e. the records in the batches are ordered by ascending id and so consecutive steps needs to
 * process the records within each batch from end to start.</li>
 * <li>{@link RelationshipLinkbackStep} processes each batch and assigns the "prev" pointers in
 * {@link RelationshipRecord} by using {@link NodeRelationshipCache}.</li>
 * <li>{@link UpdateRecordsStep} writes the updated records back into store.</li>
