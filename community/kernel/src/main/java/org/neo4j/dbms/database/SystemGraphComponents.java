/**
 * Central collection for managing multiple versioned system graph initializers. There could be several components in the DBMS that each have a requirement on
 * the system database to contain a graph with a specific schema. Each component needs to maintain that schema and support multiple versions of that schema in
 * order to allow rolling upgrades to be possible where newer versions of Neo4j will be able to run on older versions of the system database.
 * <p>
 * The core design is that each component is able to detect the version of their own sub-graph and from that decide if they can support it or not, and how to
 * upgrade from one version to another.
