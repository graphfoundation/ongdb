/**
 * The system database is used to store information of interest to many parts of the DBMS. Each sub-graph can be thought of as being of primary interest to (or
 * managed by) a particular component of the DBMS. For example, the security sub-graph composed of User, Role, Privilege and various other related nodes and
 * relationships is primarily initialized, upgraded and read by the SecurityModule.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines an external API to each component whereby external commands can ask about the current status of the component's sub-graph within the
 * system database, and also trigger upgrades (or migrations) of the sub-graph from an older version to the current version.
 * <p>
 * It is up to each component to define the rules for which older versions would be concurrently supported within any running DBMS. However, being supported
 * also means it is possible to upgrade to the current version. This means that if the <code>detect</code> method return <code>REQUIRES_UPGRADE</code>, then it
 * should be possible to call the <code>upgradeToCurrent</code> method and achieve the upgrade.
