/**
 * An adaptive page pre-fetcher for sequential scans, for either forwards (increasing page id order) or backwards (decreasing page id order) scans.
 *
 * The given page cursor is being "weakly" observed from a background pre-fetcher thread, as it is progressing through its scan, and the pre-fetcher tries
 * to touch pages ahead of the scanning cursor in order to move page fault overhead from the scanning thread to the pre-fetching thread.
 *
 * The pre-fetcher relies on {@code ordered stores} of the "current page id" from the scanner thread,
 * and on {@link UnsafeUtil#getLongVolatile(long) volatile loads} in the pre-fetcher thread, in order to observe the progress of the scanner without placing
 * too much synchronisation overhead on the scanner. Because this does not form a "synchronises-with" edge in Java Memory Model palace, we say that the
 * scanning cursor is being "weakly" observed. Ordered stores have compiler barriers, but no CPU or cache coherence barriers beyond plain stores.
 *
 * The pre-fetcher is adaptive because the number of pages the pre-fetcher will move ahead of the scanning cursor, and the length of time the pre-fetcher
 * will wait in between checking on the progress of the scanner, are dynamically computed and updated based on how fast the scanner appears to be.
 * The pre-fetcher also automatically figures out if the scanner is scanning the file in a forward or backwards direction.
