/**
 * The SwapperSet maintains the set of allocated {@link PageSwapper}s, and their mapping to swapper ids.
 * These swapper ids are a limited resource, so they must eventually be reused as files are mapped and unmapped.
 * Before a swapper id can be reused, we have to make sure that there are no pages in the page cache, that
 * are bound to the old swapper id. To ensure this, we release all pages if possible when we close file,
 * or fallback to periodic {@link MuninnPageCache#sweep(SwapperSet)} if for some reason that is not possible (we still have cursors open)
 * The sweeping process will then fully evict all pages that are bound to a page swapper ids that were released previously but failed their
 * quick round of page releases.
