/**
 * An event handler interface for transaction events. Once it has been
 * registered at a {@link DatabaseManagementService} instance it will receive events
 * about what has happened in each transaction which is about to be committed
 * and has any data that is accessible via {@link TransactionData}.
 * Handlers won't get notified about transactions which haven't performed any
 * write operation or won't be committed (either if
 * {@link Transaction#commit()} hasn't been called or the transaction has been
 * rolled back, {@link Transaction#rollback()}).
 * <p>
 * Right before a transaction is about to be committed the
 * {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData, Transaction, GraphDatabaseService)} method is called with the entire diff
 * of modifications made in the transaction. At this point the transaction is
 * still running so changes can still be made. However, there's no guarantee that
 * other handlers will see such changes since the order in which handlers are
 * executed is undefined. This method can also throw an exception and will, in
 * such a case, prevent the transaction from being committed.
 * <p>
 * If {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData, Transaction, GraphDatabaseService)} is successfully executed the
 * transaction will be committed and the
 * {@link #afterCommit(TransactionData, Object, GraphDatabaseService)} method will be called with the
 * same transaction data as well as the object returned from
 * {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData, Transaction, GraphDatabaseService)}. This assumes that all other handlers
 * (if more were registered) also executed
 * {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData, Transaction, GraphDatabaseService)} successfully.
 * <p>
 * If {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData, Transaction, GraphDatabaseService)} isn't executed successfully, but
 * instead throws an exception the transaction won't be committed. Transient errors of type {@link TransientFailureException} will (eventually) be rethrown.
 * For all other errors a {@link TransactionFailureException} will (eventually) be thrown from
 * {@link Transaction#close()}. All handlers which at this point have had its
 * {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData, Transaction, GraphDatabaseService)} method executed successfully will
 * receive a call to {@link #afterRollback(TransactionData, Object, GraphDatabaseService)}.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of a state object that the transaction handler can use to
 *            pass information from the {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData, Transaction, GraphDatabaseService)}
 *            event dispatch method to the
 *            {@link #afterCommit(TransactionData, Object, GraphDatabaseService)} or
 *            {@link #afterRollback(TransactionData, Object, GraphDatabaseService)} method, depending
 *            on whether the transaction succeeded or failed.
