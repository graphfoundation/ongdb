/**
 * A programmatically handled transaction.
 * <p>
 * <em>All database operations that access the graph, indexes, or the schema must be performed in a transaction.</em>
 * <p>
 * If you attempt to access the graph outside of a transaction, those operations will throw
 * {@link NotInTransactionException}.
 * <p>
 * Here's the idiomatic use of programmatic transactions in Neo4j:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try ( Transaction tx = graphDb.beginTx() )
 * {
 *     // operations on the graph
 *     // ...
 *
 *     tx.commit();
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Let's walk through this example line by line. First we retrieve a Transaction
 * object by invoking the {@link GraphDatabaseService#beginTx()} factory method.
 * This creates a new transaction which has internal state to keep
 * track of whether the current transaction is successful. Then we wrap all
 * operations that modify the graph in a try-finally block with the transaction
 * as resource. At the end of the block, we invoke the {@link #commit() tx.commit()}
 * method to commit that the transaction.
 * <p>
 * If an exception is raised in the try-block, {@link #commit()} will never be
 * invoked and the transaction will be roll backed. This is very important:
 * unless {@link #commit()} is invoked, the transaction will fail upon
 * {@link #close()}. A transaction can be explicitly rolled back by
 * invoking the {@link #rollback()} method.
 * <p>
 * Read operations inside of a transaction will also read uncommitted data from
 * the same transaction.
 * <p>
 * All {@link ResourceIterable ResourceIterables} that were returned from operations executed inside a transaction
 * will be automatically closed when the transaction is committed or rolled back.
 * Note however, that the {@link ResourceIterator} should be {@link ResourceIterator#close() closed} as soon as
 * possible if you don't intend to exhaust the iterator.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note that transactions should be used by a single thread only.</strong>
 * It is generally not safe to use a transaction from multiple threads.
 * Doing so will lead to undefined behavior.
