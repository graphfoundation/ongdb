    // DESIGN NOTES:
    // Only one Neo4j server should run in a single JVM in most deployments
    // and only one error consumer will be registered in such cases.
    // However, if more than one Neo4j server run in a single JVM an error consumer
    // will be registered for each of them. This means that if an error in a Reactor stream is dropped
    // in any of them, the error will be reported in a log of every server.
    // This cannot be prevented as the error cannot be linked to an instance where it occurred.
    // This is not such a big problem as this type of errors signify Fabric bugs and, ideally, should not happen.
    // And if they occur reporting them in every Neo4j server on a JVM is not such a problem.
    // The hook is never unregistered from Reactor, because the API does not allow unregistering a concrete hook,
    // but provides only an operation that removes all of them. If that operation was used, it would mean removing
    // hooks potentially added by the users outside Neo4j code base for instance in extensions or even applications
    // if the server is used in embedded mode.
