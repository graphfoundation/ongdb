        // Note: in Neo4j 4.2 checkpoints were separated out from the main transaction log files with the introduction of the "detached" checkpoint log entry.

        // though they would live in separate files they can might as well in the same place code-wise and avoid this complexity. So here we are with:
        // Neo4j version 4.2
        //  - "main" log entry version 2
        //  - "checkpoint" log entry version 3
        // With the version bump in 4.3 and merging the two it looks like this:
        // Neo4j version 4.3
        //  - log entry version 3
        //
        // This means that 4.3 reading the checkpoint log entries file will see entries with version 3, which is the same version as the detached
        // checkpoint log entries had in 4.2 and so will select this parser, which will be able to parse the detached checkpoint.
        //
        // Phew... still with me? This is merely a point of confusion up to this point. From this point on the versioning of all log entries will
        // follow the same scheme, which to some extent means slightly unnecessary version bumps for detached checkpoints if they don't change,
        // but that can be said for other log entries too that won't change between versions. And having them follow the same versioning is so
        // much easier on the brain. Thank you and good day.
