/**
 * An API for profiling threads, to see where they spend their time.
 * <p>
 * The profiler is created with the {@link #profiler()} method, and is ready to use. Threads are profiled individually, and profiling is started with the
 * {@link #profile()} family of methods. Profiling can be selectively stopped by closing the returned {@link ProfiledInterval} instance. When you are done
 * collecting profiling data, call {@link #finish()}. The {@link #finish()} method must be called before the profiling data can be printed, and calling
 * {@link #finish()} will cause all on-going profiling to stop. Once the profiling has finished, the profile data can be printed with the
 * {@link #printProfile(PrintStream, String)} method.
 * <p>
 * If you want to use the profiler again, you must call {@link #reset()} before you can start profiling again.
