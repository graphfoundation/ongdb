/**
 * A safer lifecycle adapter with strict semantics and as
 * a result simpler error handling and reasoning. If the
 * semantics of this class is not consistent with what you
 * are after, then it is probably better to create a new
 * adapter with the specific semantics required.
 * <pre>
 * Guide
 *
 *  *: No-op    (will not invoke operation)
 *  -: Error    (will throw IllegalStateException)
 *
 *  NONE:       ("pre initialization")
 *  STOPPED:    ("initialized" or "stopped")
 *  STARTED:    ("started")
 *  SHUTDOWN:   ("shutdown")
 * </pre>
 * A successful operation is an operation not throwing an exception.
 * <p>
 * End states on a successful operation.
 * <pre>
 * +----------+---------+---------+------------+-------------+
 * | FROM \op | init()  | start() |   stop()   | shutdown()  |
 * +----------+---------+---------+------------+-------------+
 * | NONE     | STOPPED | -       | -          | NONE(*)     |
 * | STOPPED  | -       | STARTED | STOPPED(*) | SHUTDOWN    |
 * | STARTED  | -       | -       | STOPPED    | -           |
 * | SHUTDOWN | -       | -       | -          | -           |
 * +----------+---------+---------+------------+-------------+
 * </pre>
 * End states on a failed operation.
 * <pre>
 *+----------+---------+---------+------------+-------------+
 * | FROM \op | init()  | start() |   stop()   | shutdown()  |
 * +----------+---------+---------+------------+-------------+
 * | NONE     | STOPPED | -       | -          | NONE(*)     |
 * | STOPPED  | -       | STOPPED | STOPPED(*) | SHUTDOWN    |
 * | STARTED  | -       | -       | STOPPED    | -           |
 * | SHUTDOWN | -       | -       | -          | -           |
 * +----------+---------+---------+------------+-------------+
 * </pre>
 * A few notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>will not invoke stop0() if start0() wasn't successful</li>
 * <li>will not invoke shutdown0() if init0() wasn't successful</li>
 * </ul>
 * The expectation with regards to error handling and cleanup is that
 * an unclean start() is cleaned up by the start0() method and thus
 * the component is left in STOPPED. The same goes for issues happening
 * during init0().
 * <p>
 * Because of the way that {@link LifeSupport} operates today, this
 * class will ignore stop() calls made while in STOPPED. Similarly, calls
 * to shutdown() will be ignored while in NONE. This allows this class
 * to be managed by a {@link LifeSupport} without throwing
 * {@link IllegalStateException} on those state transitions, which
 * otherwise would have been disallowed and handled in the same way
 * as other illegal state transitions.
 * <p>
 * This adapter will not allow a shutdown lifecycle to be reinitialized
 * and started again.
