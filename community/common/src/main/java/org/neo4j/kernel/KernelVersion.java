/**
 * One version scheme to unify various internal versions into one with the intent of conceptual simplification and simplification of version bumping.
 * The existing version byte codes originally comes from legacy versioning of the log entry versions. This kernel version now controls that said version
 * as well as the explicitly set version which a database is set to run with.
 *
 * On a high level there's a DBMS runtime version which granularity is finer and is therefore a super set of the version set in here, which only
 * contains versions that has some sort of format change. This kernel version codes doesn't follow the same codes as the DBMS runtime version codes
 * and kernel will have a translation between the two.
