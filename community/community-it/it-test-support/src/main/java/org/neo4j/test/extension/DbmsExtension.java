 * Provides test access to {@link DatabaseManagementService}. If you want an impermanent version, see

 *
 * <p>This extension will inject the following fields, if available.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link FileSystemAbstraction} as {@link DefaultFileSystemExtension}.</li>
 *     <li>{@link TestDirectory}.</li>
 *     <li>{@link DatabaseManagementService}.</li>

 *
 * <p>You can specify a callback with {@link #configurationCallback()}, this callback is invoked just before
 * the {@link DatabaseManagementServiceBuilder} completes, allowing further modifications, e.g. adding additional
 * dependencies, injecting a monitor or extension etc.
 *
 * <p>The annotation can be added to the entire test class or per test method. If any configuration values is
 * added to the annotation, the one closest to the target will be chosen. E.g. if you add the annotation to the
 * test class with a configuration, you could then add the annotation to a specific test method and thus override
 * the configuration for that method. The other test methods will not be affected by this.
