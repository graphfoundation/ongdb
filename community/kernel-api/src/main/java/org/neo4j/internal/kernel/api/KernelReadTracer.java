/**
 * Tracer of kernel API reads. The Kernel will callback the tracer methods on various key events
 * of kernel reads, allowing a tracer to analyze the read patterns.
 *
 * Note: In the initial version of this tracer we only added the callbacks that were
 *       necessary to support cypher PROFILE dbHits, and some extra which makes testing
 *       easier. If we adopt this mechanism for other uses, it might be a good idea to
 *       add additional callback, extend some callbacks with more details, or
 *       differentiate callbacks (e.g. onNode) depending on the underlying read.
