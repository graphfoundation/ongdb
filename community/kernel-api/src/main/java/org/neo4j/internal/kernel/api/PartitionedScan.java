     * Will attempt to reserve a partition to scan.
     * <p>
     * A <code>PartitionedScan</code> instance can be shared among threads and guarantees that each
     * call to <code>reservePartition</code> will reserve an exclusive partition to scan.
     * There are two basic ways to make sure all partitions are processed:
     * <p>
     * Pattern one: Look at {@link #getNumberOfPartitions() number of partitions} and
     * {@link #reservePartition(org.neo4j.internal.kernel.api.Cursor, CursorContext, AccessMode) reserve} this many partitions.
     * If using a fixed number of threads it is recommended to try and create the same number of partitions
     * since each individual partition comes with the overhead of traversing the underlying {@link GBPTree tree}.
     * Note that it might not always be possible to create the desired number of partitions and so make sure to always
     * check {@link #getNumberOfPartitions() number of partitions}.
     * Example:
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     *     for ( int i = 0; i < partitionedScan.getNumberOfPartitions(), i++ )
     *     {
     *         executor.execute( processOnePartition( partitionedScan ) );
     *     }
     *
     *     Runnable processOnePartition( PartitionedScan partitionedScan )
     *     {
     *         return () ->
     *         {
     *             try ( Cursor cursor = cursors.allocateCursor() )
     *             {
     *                 partitionedScan.reservePartition( cursor );
     *                 while ( cursor.next() )
     *                 {
     *                     // do things with the cursor
     *                 }
     *             }
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Pattern two: It is also possible to {@link #reservePartition(org.neo4j.internal.kernel.api.Cursor, CursorContext, AccessMode) reserve partitions}
     * until there are no more partitions to reserve by checking the return value. This can be done from one or multiple threads
     * Example:
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     *     try ( Cursor cursor = cursors.allocateCursor() )
     *     {
     *         while ( partitionedScan.reservePartition( cursor ) )
     *         {
     *             while ( cursor.next() )
     *             {
     *                 // do things with the cursor
     *             }
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param cursor The cursor to be used for reading.
     * @param cursorContext The underlying page cursor context for the thread doing the seek.
     * @param accessMode security store access mode.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if transaction contains changed state.
     * @return <code>true</code> if there are more data to read, otherwise <code>false</code>
