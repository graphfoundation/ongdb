     * Will attempt to reserve a batch to scan.
     * <p>
     * A <code>Scan</code> instance can be shared among threads and guarantees that each call to
     * <code>reserveBatch</code> will
     * reserve exclusive ranges for the scan. The basic usage pattern is that a single <code>Scan</code> scan instance
     * is shared among several threads but where each thread maintains separate cursors. Each thread can call
     * <code>reserveBatch</code> multiple times and then proceed to iterate the cursor as usual.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     *   try ( NodeCursor cursor = cursors.allocateCursor() )
     *   {
     *     while ( scan.reserveBatch( cursor, 42 ) )
     *     {
     *       while ( cursor.next() )
     *       {
     *         //do things with the node
     *       }
     *     }
     *   }
     * }
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Using it this way will guarantee that each scan - regardless of the calling thread - will see different parts of
     * the underlying data.
     *
     * @param cursor The cursor to be used for reading.
     * @param sizeHint The approximate size the batch, the provided size must be greater than 0.
     * @param cursorContext underlying page cache cursor context used for reserve batch underlying calls
     * @param accessMode security store access mode
     * @return <code>true</code> if there are more data to read, otherwise <code>false</code>
