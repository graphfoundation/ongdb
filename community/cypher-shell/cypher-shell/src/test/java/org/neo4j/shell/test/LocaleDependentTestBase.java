 * A helper class to mark tests as locale dependent. It has been introduced to capture / assert a couple of locale dependent tests. Alternatives that have been
 * considered
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Add corresponding configuration to the local `pom.xml` (discarded because it would require also configuration of forking etc.)</li>
 *     <li>SystemLambda to set system properties (discarded, as the default locale won't change on changed sys properties)</li>
 *     <li>Locally inside failing tests (discarded, duplicate work, will fail the next test)</li>
