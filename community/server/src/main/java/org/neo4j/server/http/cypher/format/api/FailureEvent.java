 * An event indicating a failure.

 * This event can appear anywhere in the stream except after {@link TransactionInfoEvent} event. No statements are executed after a failure,
 * so when it appears, it is typically the second last event in the stream followed only by {@link TransactionInfoEvent}.
 * <p>
 * Typically, only up to one failure event should appear in the event stream. The only case when two failure events can appear in the stream is
 * when a rollback caused by the failure also fails. The second failure message carried the reason for the rollback failure in this case.
