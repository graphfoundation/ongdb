/**
 * An event produced by {@link OutputEventSource}.
 * <p>
 * The event stream has the following general structure:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *      <ul>
 *         <li>STATEMENT_START</li>
 *         <li>RECORD</li>
 *         <li>RECORD</li>
 *         <li>RECORD</li>
 *         <li>...</li>
 *         <li>STATEMENT_END</li>
 *      </ul>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *      <ul>
 *         <li>STATEMENT_START</li>
 *         <li>RECORD</li>
 *         <li>...</li>
 *         <li>STATEMENT_END</li>
 *      </ul>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>TRANSACTION_INFO</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * TRANSACTION_INFO is always a the last event and provided information about the transaction used for processing the request.
 * FAILURE event can appear anywhere in the stream except after TRANSACTION_INFO event. No statements are executed after a failure,
 * so when it appears, it is typically the second last event in the stream followed only by TRANSACTION_INFO.
 * <p>
 * Typically, only up to one failure event should appear in the event stream. The only case when two failure events can appear in the stream is
 * when a rollback caused by the failure also fails. The second failure message carried the reason for the rollback failure in this case.
 * <p>
 * A stream with  a failure has the following general structure:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *      <ul>
 *         <li>STATEMENT_START</li>
 *         <li>RECORD</li>
 *         <li>...</li>
 *         <li>STATEMENT_END</li>
 *      </ul>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *      <ul>
 *         <li>STATEMENT_START</li>
 *         <li>RECORD</li>
 *         <li>...</li>
 *         <li>FAILURE</li>
 *      </ul>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>TRANSACTION_INFO</li>
 * </ul>
 * There is an error while the second statement is executed in the example above.
