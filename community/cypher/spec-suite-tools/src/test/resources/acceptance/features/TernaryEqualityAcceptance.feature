Feature: TernaryEqualityAcceptance

  Scenario Outline: equality between different types should yield false
    And parameters are:
      | lhs | <lhs> |
      | rhs | <rhs> |
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN $lhs = $rhs AS eq, $lhs <> $rhs AS neq
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | eq   | neq   |
      | <eq> | <neq> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | lhs        | rhs                | eq   | neq  |
      | [1, 2, 4]  | 'string'           | false | true |
      | {k: 'foo'} | 1                  | false | true |
      | 1          | 'string'           | false | true |
      | true       | 'string'           | false | true |

    And parameters are:
