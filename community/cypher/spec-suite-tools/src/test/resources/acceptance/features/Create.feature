Feature: Create

  Scenario: Dependencies in creating multiple nodes
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (a {prop: 1}), ({prop: a.prop})
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes      | 2 |
      | +properties | 2 |

  Scenario: Dependencies in creating multiple rels
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE ()-[r:R {prop:1}]->(), ()-[q:R {prop:r.prop}]->()
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 4 |
      | +relationships | 2 |
      | +properties    | 2 |
