Feature: AggregationAcceptance

  Background:
    Given an empty graph

  Scenario: Using a optional match after aggregation and before an aggregation
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:Z{key:1})-[:IS_A]->(:A)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A)

      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | aCount | zCount |
      | 1      | 1      |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Multiple aggregations should work
