Feature: TernaryComparisonAcceptance

  Scenario Outline: List comparison test
    And parameters are:
      | lhs | <lhs> |
      | rhs | <rhs> |
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN $lhs < $rhs AS lt, $lhs <= $rhs AS lte, $lhs > $rhs AS gt, $lhs >= $rhs AS gte
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | lt   | lte   | gt   | gte   |
      | <lt> | <lte> | <gt> | <gte> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | lhs       | rhs         | lt    | lte  | gt    | gte   |
      | [1, 2, 4] | [1, 3, 4]   | true  | true | false | false |
      | [1, 2, 4] | [1, 2, 4]   | false | true | false | true  |
      | [1, 2, 4] | 'string'    | null  | null | null  | null  |
      | [1, 2]    | [1, null]   | null  | null | null  | null  |
      | [1, 2]    | [2, null]   | true  | true | false | false |

  Scenario Outline: Map comparison test
    And parameters are:
      | lhs | <lhs> |
      | rhs | <rhs> |

      | lt   | lte   | gt   | gte   |
      | <lt> | <lte> | <gt> | <gte> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | lhs       | rhs         | lt    | lte  | gt    | gte   |
      | {k: 42}   | {k: 42}    | false | true | false | true  |
      | {k: 42}   | {k: 43}    | true  | true | false | false |
      | {k1: 42}  | {k2: 42}   | true  | true | false | false |
      | {k: 42}   | {k: null}  | null  | null | null  | null  |
      | {k1: 42}  | {k2: null} | true  | true | false | false |
      | {k1: 42}  | 42         | null  | null | null  | null  |

  Scenario Outline: Spatial comparison test

      | lt   | lte   | gt   | gte   |
      | <lt> | <lte> | <gt> | <gte> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | map1         | map2                        | lt    | lte   | gt    | gte   |
      | {x: 1, y: 2} | {x: 1, y: 2}                | false | true  | false | true  |
