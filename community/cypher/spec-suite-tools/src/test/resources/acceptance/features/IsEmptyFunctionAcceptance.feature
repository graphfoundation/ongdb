Feature: IsEmptyFunctionAcceptance

  Background:
    Given any graph

  Scenario: isEmpty should be null-in-null-out
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN isEmpty(null) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | result |
      | null   |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: isEmpty should return true for empty list
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN isEmpty([]) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | result |
      | true   |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: isEmpty should return false for non-empty list
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN isEmpty([1, 2, 3]) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | result |
      | false  |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: isEmpty should return false for non-empty list containing null
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN isEmpty([null]) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | result |
      | false  |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: isEmpty should return true for empty map
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN isEmpty({}) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | result |

  Scenario: isEmpty should return false for non-empty map
    When executing query:
      """

    Then the result should be, in order:
      | result |

  Scenario: isEmpty should return false for non-empty map containing null
    When executing query:

  Scenario: isEmpty should return true for empty string

  Scenario: isEmpty should return false for non-empty string
    When executing query:
      """

    Then the result should be, in order:
      | result |
      | false  |

  Scenario: isEmpty should not work for path
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:

    """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH path=(a)--(b)
      RETURN isEmpty(path) AS result
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: InvalidArgumentType
    And no side effects

  Scenario: isEmpty should not work for node
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
    """
    CREATE ()
    """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      RETURN isEmpty(a) AS result
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at runtime: InvalidArgumentValue

  Scenario: isEmpty should not work for relationship
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:

    """
    When executing query:
      """

    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
    """
    CREATE (n:Label {prop: [1, 2, 3]})
