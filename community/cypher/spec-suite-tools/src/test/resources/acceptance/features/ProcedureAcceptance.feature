Feature: ProcedureAcceptance

  Scenario: Standalone void-procedure call
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure proc.void() :: ():
      |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL proc.void()
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Void-procedure call after a MATCH clause
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
    """
      CREATE (:Node)
      CREATE (:Node)
     """
    And there exists a procedure proc.void() :: ():
      |
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (node:Node)
      CALL proc.void()
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And no side effects

  @allowCustomErrors
  Scenario: Non-void-procedure call after a MATCH clause fails
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
    """
      CREATE (:Node)
      CREATE (:Node)
     """
    And there exists a procedure proc.yielding(in :: INTEGER?) :: (out :: INTEGER?):
      | in | out |
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (node:Node)
      CALL proc.yielding(5)
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: Procedure call inside a query does not support naming results implicitly (name explicitly using `YIELD` instead)

  Scenario: Procedure call after a MATCH clause fails when YIELD also present
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
    """
      CREATE (:Node)
      CREATE (:Node)
     """
    And there exists a procedure proc.yielding(in :: INTEGER?) :: (out :: INTEGER?):

    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (node:Node)
      CALL proc.yielding(5) YIELD out
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: InvalidClauseComposition
