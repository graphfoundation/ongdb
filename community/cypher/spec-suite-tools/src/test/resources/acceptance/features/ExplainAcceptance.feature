Feature: ExplainAcceptance

  Background:
    Given an empty graph

  Scenario: Explanation of standalone procedure call
    And there exists a procedure test.labels() :: (label :: STRING?):
      | label |
      | 'A'   |
      | 'B'   |
      | 'C'   |
    When executing query:
    """
    EXPLAIN CALL test.labels()
    """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | label |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Explanation of in-query procedure call
    And there exists a procedure test.labels() :: (label :: STRING?):
      | label |
      | 'A'   |
      | 'B'   |
      | 'C'   |
    When executing query:
    """
    EXPLAIN
    CALL test.labels() YIELD label
    RETURN *
    """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | label |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Explanation of query with return columns
    When executing query:
    """
    EXPLAIN
    MATCH (a)-[r]->(b)
    RETURN a, r, b
    """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a | r | b |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Explanation of query without return columns
    When executing query:
    """
    EXPLAIN
    CREATE (a)
    """
    Then the result should be empty
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Explanation of query ending in unit subquery call
    When executing query:
    """
    EXPLAIN
    MATCH (n)
    CALL {
      CREATE (a)
    }
    """
    Then the result should be empty
    And no side effects
