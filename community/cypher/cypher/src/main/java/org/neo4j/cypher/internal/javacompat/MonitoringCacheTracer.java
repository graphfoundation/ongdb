/**
 * Adapter from ExecutionEngineQueryCacheMonitor to CacheTracer.
 *
 * The reason why we
 * a) need an adapter and
 * b) tracers for the ExpressionEngine query cache and the CypherPlanner query cache need to implement two different
 *    interfaces (ExecutionEngineQueryCacheMonitor and CacheTracer respectively)
 *
 *  is that kernel monitors work by interface methods. If tracers for those two caches shared the abstract methods
 *  in the same superclass, the monitor callbacks would always be invoked from both caches. So we need this
 *  awful mumbo-jumbo in order to monitor specifically one of the two caches only.
