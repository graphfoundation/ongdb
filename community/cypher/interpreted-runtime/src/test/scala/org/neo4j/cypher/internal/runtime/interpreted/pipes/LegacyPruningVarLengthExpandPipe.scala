   * Performs DFS traversal, but omits traversing relationships that have been completely traversed (to the

   * Pruning and full expand depths
   * The full expand depth is an integer that denotes how deep a relationship has previously been explored. For
   * example, a full expand depth of 2 would mean that all nodes that can be reached by following this relationship
   * and maximally one more permitted relationship have already been visited. A relationship is permitted if is
   * conforms to the var-length predicates (which is controlled at expand time), and the relationship is not already
   * part of the current path.
   *
   * Before emitting a node (after relationship traversals), the PruningDFS updates the full expand depth of the
   * incoming relationship on the previous node in the path. The full expand depth is computed as
   * 1                 if the max path length is reached
   * A_VERY_BIG_VALUE  if the node has no relationships except the incoming one
   * d+1               otherwise, where d is the minimum outgoing full expand depth

   * @param path                     The path so far. Only the first pathLength elements are valid.
   * @param pathLength               Length of the path so far
   * @param state                    The QueryState
   * @param row                      The current row we are adding reachable nodes to

   *
   *                                 For this algorithm the incoming relationship is the one traversed to reach this
