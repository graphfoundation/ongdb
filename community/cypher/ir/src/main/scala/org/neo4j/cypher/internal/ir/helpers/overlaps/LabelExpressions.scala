  /**
   * Add a new expression to the accumulated conjunction.
   * If the expression refers to labels that haven't been encountered so far, we first grow the list of candidates to account for it.
   * We then shrink that list down by matching each candidate against the label expression.
   *
   * For example, if we want to find all the solution for the following node pattern (:% & !(A&B) & C), we evaluate:
   * {{{[:%, :!(A&B), :C].foldLeft(LabelExpressions.any)(_ and _)}}}
   * Here is how it unrolls using ∅ to represent the empty set of labels, and ? to represent a non-empty set of yet unknown labels:
   * {{{
   *    Start: {∅, ?}
   *    .and(:%):
   *      (:%).allLabels is empty, no need to grow our list of solutions: {∅, ?}
   *      solutions.filter(:%) rules out ∅: {?}
   *    .and(:!(A&B)):
   *      (:!(A&B)).allLabels introduces labels A and B, solutions grows to: {A, B, AB, ?}
   *      solutions.filter(:!(A&B)) rules out AB: {A, B, ?}
   *    .and(:C):
   *      (:C).allLabels introduces label C, solutions grows to: {AC, BC, C, ?}
   *      solutions.filter(:C) rules out ?: {AC, BC, C}
   * }}}
   *
   * Note that {AC, BC, C} is the set of all solutions in the context of {A, B, C} being all the known labels so far.
   * AC really represents {A, C} and any combination of labels not in {A, B, C} as it is impossible to match on AC exclusively.
   * There is one exception: the empty set of labels ∅. We can specifically match on it using (:!%), and so ∅ exclusively refers to empty set of labels regardless of context.
   *
   * This only builds the computation, but does not actually execute it, no evaluation happens before the first value gets pulled.
