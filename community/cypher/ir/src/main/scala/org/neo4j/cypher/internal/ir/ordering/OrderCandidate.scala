/**
 * A candidate for how the rows in a query can be sorted, defined by OrderCandidate.order.
 * A candidate can be required (i.e. the rows need to sorted like this for correctness)
 * or interesting (i.e. sorting the rows like this will allow for performance optimizations).
 *
 * There can be multiple candidates since different parts of a query can leverage different orders for their respective optimizations.
