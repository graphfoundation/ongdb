/**
 * Represents the set of labels on a given node in the context of solving a node pattern.
 * For example KnownLabels({A,B}) is a solution to (:A&B).
 * SomeUnknownLabels is a more subtle beast, it represent a node containing at least one label that isn't known yet.
 * For example, given the pattern (:!%|%), KnownLabels({}) is the unique solution to !%, and SomeUnknownLabels the synthetic representation of all solutions to %, to be materialised later on.
 * Similarly, evaluating (:%&!(A&B)) gives us the following solutions: {A}, {B}, and SomeUnknownLabels.
