/**
 * The default implementation of a Top N table used by all runtimes
 *
 * It accepts tuples as boxed objects that implements Comparable
 *
 * Implements the following interface:
 * (since the code is generated it does not actually need to declare it with implements)
 *
 * public interface SortTable<T>
 * {
 *     boolean add( T e );
 *
 *     void sort();
 *
 *     Iterator<T> iterator();

 *
 * Uses a max heap to collect a maximum of {@code totalCount} tuples in reverse order.
 * When sort() is called, it does a heap sort in-place which will reverse the order
 * again, resulting in a fully sorted array which the iterator will go through.
