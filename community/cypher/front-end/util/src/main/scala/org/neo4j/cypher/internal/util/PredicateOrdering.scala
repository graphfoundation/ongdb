/**
 * Predicates should be ordered such that the overall cost per row is minimized.
 * A predicate here is represented by the cost per row to evaluate the predicate
 * and by its selectivity.
 *
 * Given c0 as the cost for predicate0 and s0 as the selectivity of predicate0
 * (and analogous for other predicates), predicate0 should be evaluated before
 * predicate1 iff c0 + s0 * c1 > c1 + s1 * c0.
 *
 * This is a well defined ordering. Given predicate0, predicate1 and predicate2,
 * where
 *
 * I:  c0 + s0 * c1 > c1 + s1 * c0 (predicate0 comes before predicate1)
 * II: c1 + s1 * c2 > c2 + s2 * c1 (predicate1 comes before predicate2)
 * and all c_i and s_i are positive.
 *
 * we can show that predicate0 comes before predicate2:
 *
 * I:    c0 + s0 * c1            > c1 + s1 * c0                   | -c1
 *       c0 + s0 * c1 - c1       >      s1 * c0                   | /c0
 *      (c0 + s0 * c1 - c1) / c0 >      s1
 *
 * II: c1 + s1 * c2 >  c2 + s2 * c1                               | -c1
 *          s1 * c2 >  c2 + s2 * c1 - c1                          | /c2
 *          s1      > (c2 + s2 * c1 - c1) / c2
 *
 * Substitute s1 in I:
 *   (c0 + s0 * c1 - c1) / c0 > (c2 + s2 * c1 - c1) / c2
 *    1 + (s0 * c1 - c1) / c0 >  1 + (s2 * c1 - c1) / c2          | -1
 *        (s0 * c1 - c1) / c0 >      (s2 * c1 - c1) / c2          | /c1
 *        (s0 - 1)       / c0 >      (s2 - 1)       / c2          | *c0
 *        (s0 - 1)            >      (s2 - 1) * c0  / c2          | *c2
 *        (s0 - 1) * c2       >      (s2 - 1) * c0
 *        s0 * c2 - c2        >      s2 * c0 - c0                 | +c0
 *   c0 + s0 * c2 - c2        >      s2 * c0                      | +c2
 *   c0 + s0 * c2             > c2 + s2 * c0
