  Test asserts that unsafe rewrite is not performed.
  Because IS NULL & IS NOT NULL are binary operators, whereas Exists is ternary, this rewrite is only safe when the node is not nullable.
  Nullability information is not yet available at time of AST rewriting:
     >          MATCH (n) WHERE n.foo IS NOT NULL RETURN n
     >          MATCH (n) WHERE exists(n.foo)     RETURN n
     > OPTIONAL MATCH (n) WHERE n.foo IS NOT NULL RETURN n
     > OPTIONAL MATCH (n) WHERE exists(n.foo)     RETURN n     <---- unsafe
   In the OPTIONAL MATCH case when n is null:
     > n IS NOT NULL  ==>  false
     > exists(n.foo)  ==>  null
       > null.foo     == null
       > exists(null) == null
