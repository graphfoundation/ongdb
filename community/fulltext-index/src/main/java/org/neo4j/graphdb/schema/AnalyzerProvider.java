 * This is the base-class for all service-loadable factory classes, that build the Lucene Analyzer instances that are available to the fulltext schema index.
 * The analyzer factory is referenced in the index configuration via its {@code analyzerName} and {@code alternativeNames} that are specific to the constructor
 * of this base class. Sub-classes must have a public no-arg constructor such that they can be service-loaded.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example that implements an analyzer provider for the {@code SwedishAnalyzer} that comes built into Lucene:
 *

 * public class Swedish extends AnalyzerProvider

 *     public Swedish()
