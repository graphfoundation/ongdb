/**
 * An index searcher implementation delegates to the given {@link StatsCollector} for computing its term and collection statistics.
 * This makes it possible for this index searcher to create weights and scorers that are calibrated to the aggregate statistics of multiple indexes.
 * Aggregating the statistics is useful when a full-text index spans multiple partitions, or when transaction state needs to be taken into account as well.
 * Without the aggregate statistics, the scores computed from each search in the individual partitions, will not be comparable.
