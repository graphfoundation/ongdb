/**
 * Record storage specific locking. (See also  {@link ResourceTypes}
 *
 * To avoid deadlocks, they should be taken in the following order
 * <dl>
 *     <dt>{@link ResourceTypes#LABEL} or {@link ResourceTypes#RELATIONSHIP_TYPE} - Token id</dt>
 *     <dd>Schema locks, will lock indexes and constraints on the particular label or relationship type.</dd>
 *
 *     <dt>{@link ResourceTypes#SCHEMA_NAME} - Schema name (XXH64 hashed)</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         Lock a schema name to avoid duplicates. Note, collisions are possible since we hash the string, but this only affect concurrency and not correctness.
 *     </dd>
 *
 *     <dt>{@link ResourceTypes#NODE_RELATIONSHIP_GROUP_DELETE} - Node id</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         Lock taken on a node during the transaction creation phase to prevent deletion of said node and/or relationship group.
 *         This is different from the {@link ResourceTypes#NODE} to allow concurrent label and property changes together with relationship modifications.
 *     </dd>
 *
 *     <dt>{@link ResourceTypes#NODE} - Node id</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         Lock on a node, used to prevent concurrent updates to the node records, i.e. add/remove label, set property, add/remove relationship.
 *         Note that changing relationships will only require a lock on the node if the head of the relationship chain/relationship group chain
 *         must be updated, since that is the only data part of the node record.
 *     </dd>
 *
 *     <dt>{@link ResourceTypes##DEGREES} - Node id</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         Used to lock nodes to avoid concurrent label changes with relationship addition/deletion. This would otherwise lead to inconsistent count store.
 *     </dd>
 *
 *     <dt>{@link ResourceTypes##RELATIONSHIP_DELETE} - Relationship id</dt>
 *     <dd>Lock a relationship for exclusive access during deletion.</dd>
 *
 *     <dt>{@link ResourceTypes##RELATIONSHIP_GROUP} - Node id</dt>
 *     <dd>
 *         Lock the full relationship group chain for a given node(dense). This will not lock the node in contrast to
 *         {@link ResourceTypes##NODE_RELATIONSHIP_GROUP_DELETE}.
 *     </dd>
 *
 *     <dt>{@link ResourceTypes#RELATIONSHIP} - Relationship id</dt>
 *     <dd>Lock on a relationship, or more specifically a relationship record, to prevent concurrent updates.</dd>
