     * A threshold used when reading chains of records. There's a chance that a chain contains a cycle, at which point
     * it's impossible to get to the end of the chain normally. If no cycle detection is in place then reading it
     * would never end. The idea is that readers of chains first count how many records it traverses and if crossing
     * this threshold it will start to track uniqueness among the seen record IDs and if observing non-unique IDs then
     * the conclusion is that the chain contains a cycle and must be aborted (with an exception of this type).
     *
     * The threshold itself doesn't impose any limit on chain length, it's merely a trigger to start inspecting the chain
     * more closely as it's traversed.
