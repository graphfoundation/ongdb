/**
 * Groups property commands by entity. The commands are provided from a list of transaction commands.
 * Most entity updates include both the entity command as well as property commands, but sometimes
 * only property commands for an entity exists in the list and this grouper handles both scenarios.
 * Commands are appended to an array and then sorted before handed over for being processed.
 * Hence one entity group can look like any of these combinations:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Entity command ({@link NodeCommand} or {@link RelationshipCommand} followed by zero or more {@link PropertyCommand property commands}
 *     for that entity</li>
 *     <li>zero or more {@link PropertyCommand property commands}, all for the same node</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Typical interaction goes like this:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>All commands are added with {@link #add(Command)}</li>
 *     <li>Get a cursor to the sorted commands using {@link #sortAndAccessGroups()}</li>
 *     <li>Call {@link #clear()} and use this instance again for another set of commands</li>
 * </ol>
