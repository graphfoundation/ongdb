/**
 * Relationship/relationship group references that are exposed from the kernel API surface into the client
 * will have some flags encoded into them, basically to provide some context which will be lost when exiting the kernel.
 * The flags will help recreated that context when these references are passed back into the kernel API, i.e. when client uses them later.
 * <p>
 * Among the reasons we need to encode references are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>relationship group references exists as a thing that can be exposed outside the cursors, where context is lost</li>
 *     <li>relationship group references can actually be a relationship reference at times (at least in the record storage implementation)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Specifically for the record storage engine it is because there are dense and non-dense nodes. A dense node will have a
 * pointer into the relationship group store, while a non-dense node points directly to the relationship store. On
 * retrieving a relationship reference from a dense node, we therefore have to transparently encode in the reference
 * that it actually points to a group. When the kernel then serves a relationship cursor using the reference, we need
 * to silently detect that we have a group reference, parse the groups, and setup the cursor to serve relationship
 * via this mode instead.
 * <p>
 * Note that {@code -1} is used to encode that a reference is invalid. In terms of
 * encoding {@code -1} is considered to have all flags, so setting one will not change {@code -1}. This however also
 * means that calling code must check for {@code -1} references before checking flags existence.
 * <p>
 * Finally, an encoded reference cannot be used directly as an id to acquire the referenced object. Before using
 * the reference, the encoding must be cleared with {@link #clearEncoding(long)}. To guard against using an
 * encoded reference, all encoded references are marked so they appear negative.
