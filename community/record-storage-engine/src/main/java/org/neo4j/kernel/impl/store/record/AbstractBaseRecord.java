/**
 * {@link AbstractBaseRecord records} are intended to be reusable. Created with a zero-arg constructor
 * and initialized with the public {@code initialize} method exposed by the specific record implementations,
 * or {@link #clear() cleared} if reading a record that isn't in use.
 *
 * Regarding secondary unit there are three state fields involving secondary unit. This is an explanation of what they mean and how they relate to each other:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #requiresSecondaryUnit()} set when a record is prepared, at a time where actual ids cannot be allocated, for one or more reasons.
 *     This state is accessed at some point later and if this record doesn't have a secondary unit it assigned already, such an id will be allocated
 *     and assigned {@link #setSecondaryUnitIdOnLoad(long)} and the {@link #setSecondaryUnitIdOnCreate(long)} flag raised because it was set right now.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getSecondaryUnitId()} set when a large record requires a secondary unit. If such a large record is created right now
 *     (and not loaded from store) the {@link #setSecondaryUnitIdOnCreate(long)} should also be set to reflect this fact.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #isSecondaryUnitCreated()} whether or not the secondary unit in this record (assuming it has one) was created now
 *     and wasn't there when it was loaded from the store</li>
 * </ul>
