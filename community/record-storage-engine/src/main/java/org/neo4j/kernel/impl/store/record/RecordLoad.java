 * If in use then record is loaded into target and returns {@code true},
 * otherwise return {@code false}.</li>
 * <li>{@link RecordLoad#NORMAL}: Load at least data to determine whether it's in use or not.
 * if in use then record is loaded into target returns {@code true},
 * otherwise throws {@link InvalidRecordException}.</li>
 * <li>{@link RecordLoad#FORCE}: Loads record data into target regardless of whether record in use or not.
 * Returns whether record is in use or not.
 * <li>{@link RecordLoad#ALWAYS}: always load all record data, even if the record is marked as not in use, but unlike {@link RecordLoad#FORCE} it will
 * throw decoding and out-of-bounds exceptions. Will not throw InvalidRecordExceptions for records that are not in use.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are also "LENIENT" variants of all those (except #FORCE), with the difference that reading a record which is not the first unit
 * in a multi-unit record won't raise a cursor exception.
